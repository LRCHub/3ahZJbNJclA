Some ladies love me
Some ladies don't
But I know what you're gonna do
Even when you say you won't

I know you want me
You got desire
Out of the frying pan
Into the fire

Drawn to the flame
Your hands are tied
You wanna take me, baby
All up inside

You feel the hunger
But it's much too much
You can look baby
Uh, uh, uh but you just can't touch

This is Russian Roulette
One pull of the trigger is all you're gonna get
The deck is loaded but I like what I see
You're gonna lose it all eventually

You got me where you want me
Go on, take a bite
Open up, let our backbone slip
Such a pretty sight

You try to talk
But you just can't speak
Your pulse is strong
But your knees are weak

You feel the hunger
But it's much too much
You can look, baby
Uh, uh, uh but you just can't touch

This is Russian Roulette
One pull of the trigger is all you're gonna get
The deck is loaded but I like what I see
You're gonna lose it all eventually

You feel the hunger
And it's much too much
You can look, baby
Uh, uh, uh but you just can't touch

This is Russian Roulette
One pull of the trigger is all you're gonna get
The deck is loaded but I like what I see

This is Russian Roulette
One pull of the trigger is all you're gonna get
The deck is loaded but I like what I see
You're gonna lose it all eventually
