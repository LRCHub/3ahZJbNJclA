Take a breath, take it deep
"Calm yourself," he says to me
If you play, you play for keeps
Take the gun, and count to three
I'm sweating now, moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go

And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified, but I'm not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger

Say a prayer to yourself
He says, "Close your eyes, sometimes it helps"
And then I get a scary thought
That he's here means he's never lost

And you can see my heart beating
Oh, you can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified, but I'm not leaving
Know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger
Pull the trigger

You can see my heart beating
That I'm terrified
You can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
I'm terrified, but I'm not leaving, no
Know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger
