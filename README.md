# Porter Robinson – Russian Roulette

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
It's me, smiling for the team
As I stare directly
into the storm, oh
Trust me
It's a sure thing
Russian Roulette
You won't get bored
Best friend
We don't have to pretend one day
I could make you your salary oh
The saddest thing
About my whole machine
She says, and she's right
It depends on me
Then I close my eyes
Gamble with my life
Trying not to smile
Maybe this time
I won't be alright
Maybe this time
Pitchfork reports
They're calling me
Their words:
"The big new thing", oh
YouTube review
Funny monkey
Takes a piss into his own mouth
Crazy
And I thought
It strange
To sell
My face
But let's just make
the most of it
My hand is drawn
I put the gun
Against the thing
that's stopping me
Then I close my eyes
Gamble with my life
Trying not to smile
Maybe this time
I won't be alright
Maybe this time
A bad guy just died
They're making memes about it
Nothing matters now
Go fuck myself?
I already did
My friend lost his head
And what'd I do about it?
And we could laugh
about the thoughts
that I've been having
Then I close my eyes.
Gamble with my life
Trying not to smile
Maybe this time
I won't be alright
Maybe this time
I wanna see my mom one more time
I wanna play my songs
one more time
I wanna lose my phone
one more time
I wanna play in the snow
one more time
I wanna kiss my cat
one more time
I wanna thank my dad
one more time
I wanna marry her one more time
I wanna live I don't want die
I wanna try to change
one more time
I wanna live I don't wanna die
I wanna live I don't wanna die
I wanna live
The kick drum and bass suggests
the song is coming to a close
Boo
That's the format we are used to
Cliches like this are beautiful,
because they reflect us,
and we are beautiful
Yay!
Take, for example,
this chord progression
It only became taboo
because it was too powerful
That's why you won't forget it
Don't kill yourself, you idiot
